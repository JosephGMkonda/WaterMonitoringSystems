WaterPoints Monitoring System (Borehole Tracking Project)

Access to clean water remains a major challenge in many 
communities. NGOs and government agencies often drill boreholes
to provide safe water,
but once a borehole breaks, thereâ€™s usually no tracking system 
for maintenance. As a result, communities revert to unsafe water 
sources, risking waterborne diseases.

This project monitors boreholes and waterpoints across
Malawi using data from the World Bank API, tracking locations,
status, and usage trends. For example, the borehole shown here
was broken nearly five years ago with no maintenance, leaving
the community without safe water.
